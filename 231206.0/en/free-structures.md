## Free Structures

The main idea of RTS is to give developers the ability to create 
and manipulate free data structures without rigid constraints. 
The structures can interact reactively with each other, providing 
dynamic behavior. This allows the programmer to implement any 
possible interaction, from the simplest structures to full systems.

RTS can also handle multiple projects or scripts simultaneously, 
ensuring they do not interfere with each other. Additionally, the 
programmer has full control over the interaction between structures, 
as they can customize it according to their needs. Therefore, 
although RTS does not include the familiar constructs, they can be 
easily written from scratch or imported from available packages, 
minimizing the need for unnecessary constructs in your project.
