Welcome to the RTS documentation!

<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

RTS uses its own reactive programming paradigm of Free Data Structures. This differs from classical approaches such as procedural, object-oriented, functional and other types of programming. The main feature is that the programmer is given the freedom to write any data structures, their reactive interaction and trouble-free operation. RTS negates the concept of errors, there is only unexpected behavior. Thus, the code directly depends on the goals, imagination and skill of the programmer.

The goals and objectives of RTS:

* Rapid Deployment: Simplified setup and project launch;
* Global Repository: Centralized management of dependencies and packages;
* Interpretation: Ability to execute code on the fly, speeding up project development;
* Multitasking: Running multiple projects simultaneously;
* Machine Code: Direct execution on the processor for maximum performance;
* Flexible Data Management: Unrestricted structures allow working with data without strict limitations;
* Reactivity: Automatic processing of changes.

Thus, RTS is ideal for tasks that require rapid deployment, support for running multiple projects simultaneously, high performance, and reliability. It automates processes in systems with dynamic changes, while also providing freedom for further development.
