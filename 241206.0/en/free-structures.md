## Free Structures

The core idea of RTS is to allow developers to create and manage 
free data structures without rigid constraints. These structures 
can also interact reactively with each other, providing dynamic 
behavior. This enables the programmer to implement any possible 
interaction, from simple structures to full-fledged systems.

You should also define your programming style, as this will depend 
on the goals and requirements of your project. In RTS, you can 
implement structures starting from the smallest details. This will 
help you understand what management mechanisms you need.

### Denial of Errors

In RTS, we deny the concept of errors, expecting either constant 
behavior or unforeseen behavior. Constant behavior refers to the 
behavior of the elementary structures of the language. This includes 
Int, UInt, Float, UFloat, and many other basic data structures. 
It can be compared to the rules of nature around us.

Based on basic elements, it is possible to safely build any more 
complex systems if you follow the rules of constant behavior. 
If necessary, you can also create additional checks and protection 
mechanisms for your structures.

### Reactivity and Modularity

RTS interprets code in real time and can handle multiple projects 
or scenarios simultaneously, ensuring they do not interfere with 
each other.

You can also configure the interaction between structures to suit 
your needs, as well as break your program into modules. Therefore, 
while RTS does not include familiar constructs, they can be easily 
written from scratch or imported from available packages, minimizing 
the need for unnecessary constructs in your project.
