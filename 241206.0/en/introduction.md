## Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for the RTS programming language!
This language provides you with the ability to create fast-deployable, 
seamless, dynamic, and modern software.

This page offers an overview of the programming language and this 
documentation.

### About RTS

RTS is based on the Free Data Structures paradigm, combining it with 
reactive behavior. This sets it apart from traditional approaches such 
as procedural, object-oriented, functional, and other programming paradigms. 
The key feature is that developers have the freedom to create any data 
structures, whether using structured or unstructured programming.

RTS provides reactive interaction and fault-free operation of structures — 
it rejects the concept of errors, recognizing only unexpected behavior. 
As a result, the code directly depends on the programmer’s goals, 
creativity, and skills. In this case, The Programmer Is Envisioned as 
Creator and a Manager.

The goals and objectives of RTS:

* Rapid Deployment: Simplified setup and project launch;
* Global Repository: Centralized management of dependencies and packages;
* Interpretation: Ability to execute code on the fly, speeding up project development;
* Multitasking: Running multiple projects simultaneously;
* Machine Code: Direct execution on the processor for maximum performance;
* Flexible Data Management: Unrestricted structures allow working with data without strict limitations;
* Reactivity: Automatic processing of changes.

Thus, RTS is ideal for tasks that require rapid deployment, support for
running multiple projects simultaneously, high performance, and reliability.
It automates processes in systems with dynamic changes, while also providing
freedom for further development.
